### **9. Correlation Matrix**

## **Linear Regression Analysis**
To predict **price** based on the **number of reviews**, a simple linear regression model was built. The results are as follows:
- **Regression Coefficients**:
  - Intercept (`beta_0`): **154.32**
  - Slope (`beta_1`): **-0.19**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: **51088.91**

### **Interpretation**:
- The negative slope indicates that as the number of reviews increases, the price tends to decrease.
- The high MSE suggests that the model has room for improvement, possibly by including additional features like room type or location.

## **Recommendations**
1. **Focus on Affordable Listings**: Since lower-priced listings receive more reviews and bookings, hosts should consider competitive pricing strategies.
2. **Target High-Demand Areas**: Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most popular areas. Hosts in these regions should optimize their listings to attract more guests.
3. **Encourage Longer Stays**: Listings with higher minimum night requirements tend to have higher prices. Hosts can target business travelers or families by offering discounts for longer stays.
4. **Improve Availability**: Listings with high availability receive more reviews. Hosts should ensure their properties are available during peak travel seasons.
5. **Enhance Model Accuracy**: Future analyses should include additional features like room type, location, and amenities to improve the predictive power of the regression model.

## **Conclusion**
This analysis provides valuable insights into the Airbnb market in New York. By understanding pricing trends, customer preferences, and geographical distribution, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize their listings and maximize revenue. The linear regression model, while simple, highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when predicting prices.
